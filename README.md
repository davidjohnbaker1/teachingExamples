From Aural Skills to Z Scores!

This page hosts examples of example syllabi, teaching materials, as well as my current project in development of writing a statistics handbook for the LSU Graduate Psychology Statistics courses.

During my first two years at Louisiana State University I was employed by the Music School and taught as Instructor of Record on Foundations of Music Study, Aural Skills III (Chromaticism) and Aural Skills IV. 
After my second year I worked as a graduate assistant for the Intermediate and Multivariate Statistics courses.
As part of my assistantship I created an online, interactive book so future students wanting to learn R with the current materials could supplement their own education.
The book is still under development, but you can see the latest render of the book [here](https://davidjohnbaker1.github.io/rForPsychHandbook/).
